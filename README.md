# Culturebuffgames-Directory-Exposure-and-Admin-Access-Leakage-Report
## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to report a potential security vulnerability I discovered while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
During my search using Google Dorks, I discovered a vulnerability on the website **https://culturebuffgames.com/**. Specifically, I found a directory listing exposed, and unauthorized admin access is possible through the following link:  
`https://culturebuffgames.com/resources/`

This vulnerability could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive files and potentially the admin panel, posing a significant security risk to the website.

### Sensitive Information Found:
- Directory listing exposed at the URL `https://culturebuffgames.com/resources/`.
- Admin access could be leaked due to insufficient access controls.

> **Note**: The link is functional and accessible.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Google Dorks to search for publicly exposed directories.
2. Visit the vulnerable link
3.Report it.

## Recommendation
Please investigate this issue and ensure that proper security measures are taken to protect sensitive areas on your website. Specifically, consider implementing access controls and preventing directory listings to secure files that should not be publicly accessible.
